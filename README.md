# In-Class-SandBox

Here, I am learning about using Git as my version control system.

The `README.md` file is  amarkdown file where I can share important notes about my code repository.

I can create  **bold** text (wrapped by two asterisks) or *italic* text (wrapped by one asterisks).

I can create fenced code blocks using back-ticks, like this:

```csharp
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
Cosole.Writeline("Hello World");
}
```

I am learning about

- Creating a git repository (online, and on my computer)
- Synchronizing my git repository on [GitHub](https://github.com)
